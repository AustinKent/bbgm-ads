individual unit refresh (like lazy loading ads below, maybe)
- test on http://beta.sports.ws/bs.php box scores
- integration tests
  - lazy ad unit is not displayed on initial load
  - lazy ad unit is displayed on appropriate refresh call
  - lazy ad unit refresh logic (not too soon)
- user test
  - lazy, in FBGM or something
  - auto refresh, both for normal and lazy

flex ads
- what we have now, with labelAny and sizeConfig... does that just apply to the bidders and not adx? If so, do I need to do something like https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/3423562?hl=en too?
- austin has the ad unit config in DFP specify valid sizes, but not breakpoints

lazy loading ads
- provide some way to trigger bbgm-ads to...
  1. update this.lastRefreshTime to prevent double auction
  2. display just the new ad units (not sure if it can be a refresh, or some stuff from init is needed)
  3. add new ad units to all the data structures, so it's part of future refreshes
  OR
  1. set some flag, so that the new ad units (already part of adUnits and loaded) will now actually be displayed
    - EASY HACKY WAY - set display: none on the div, remove when loaded
      - better: data- property
  2. do a refresh of the new ad units (set this.lastRefreshTime to 0 to ensure refresh, or add "force" param)
